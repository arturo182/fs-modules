## How to use

In `./module/webpack.config.js` you will see `projectPath` close to the top, change this path to where your project is located.

```sh
# Go to the module folder
$ cd ./module

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Build the module in dev mode with watch, so that when you
# make a change, the project will rebuild.
#
# This will build unoptimized javascript code of the module.
$ npm run dev

# This will build optimized javascript code of the module.
$ npm run build

# This will build a release package for the module.
$ npm run release
```
